    "During the covid pandemic, governments tried to predict the levels of infection so that they could manage the required infrastructure, especially hospital beds and (sadly) mortuary places. In this mini-project, you will take data from two different, publicly available, sources and try to see how well you could have done if you had been working for the UK government.  One of the sources is the UK data from the period and the other is googleâ€™s data on our behaviour during the pandemic.\n",

    "You will use data up to a specific date to predict hospital beds needed, and deaths that will occur  in one, two, three and four weeks from that date.  You will do this for the whole pandemic period i.e. using a rolling  window. You will also quantify how well your prediction works."

    "## Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow our ML model to have the most predictive power, one of the most important steps is to feed the ML model the appropriate features so it can learn the complex relationships between the features and the target variable. Due to the high dimensionality and associated complexity of the data, the best approach will be to use Random Forest Regressor or XG Boost Regressor. These models have the capability to handle complex data whilst maintaining a managable computational cost. However, the list of all features from all the healthcare, testing, deaths, vaccinations, cases database is large. Therefore, to reduce the features down to a manageble level, some feature engineering has to be performed. Either LASSO or PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. However, some features can already be removed based off requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Removed features\n",
    "\n",
    "**cum**: Any variable that are cumulative are irrelevant for the prediction of covid beds/deaths. The cumulative cases, or the cumulative admissions would not affect the current rolling prediction of covid beds/deaths. *Note: Exception applies to vaccination and potentially testing data where the cumulative vaccinations (1st dose/ 2nd dose etc.) would indicate a lower probability of (re)infection for those people. So all the cumulative data was preserved only in the vaccination and testing dataset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**weekly**: All the weekly data was removed because the data was aggregated for the week thus making it irrelevant when there is daily data already available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**archive**: Any archived data was removed because those datapoints were from the past so not relevant when making current predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**publishdate**: In the testing datasets especially, many features had an equivalent publish date which was the date when the case/infection/death got recorded. Again, when the case/infection/death was regarded is irrelevant. Only the date of, say, death matters for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**registrationdate**: Similar to publish date, registration date is another formality of when the data was recorded and again not relevant for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**direction**: The direction features in the datasets indicate whether a certain feature is going up or down, which is not really important considering we already have numerically data. Furthermore, this will be highly correlated with the numerical data and provide no additional information but rather add unecessary features which will increase the computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**change/percentage**: This provides the change or percentage change which is ignored for now as we have the numerical data available already. This is a sort of 50/50 call to reduce the number of features. Latter we can try including these featurs to see the change that the features bring to the predicitve power of the model, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "For vaccination and testing - two new considerations were included:\n",
    "\n",
    "**cum**: For vaccination and testing it does matter how many new people have been tested/vaccinated rather the total sum is more important. So cumulative features were left in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**new**: The daily change/the new number of people infected does not really matter. Only the total sum matters becaues it represents the people that are less likely to get infected. So any new change features were left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "For vaccinations, one final additon:\n",
    "\n",
    "**dose**: For vaccinations we are mainly interested in the total dosage given to people. The vaccinations and testing datasets are similar and probably closely correlated so we are only interested in a few features from the vaccination dataset such as the dosage.\n",

The 'day' column will allow the model to understand weekend effects; the 'month' column will allow the model to understand seasonal variations and the year column will aid the model in understanding long time variations. Once, the LASSO is implemented in the next section it will become obvious whether any of these periodic features will be useful or not. These features need to be `OneHotEncoded`. This is done because ML algorithms usually work based on distance. So, for example, the 'days' column assigns 5 for Saturday and 6 for Sunday and 0 for Monday. Thus, the ML model would assume a bigger difference between Sunday and Monday compared to between Saturday and Sunday even though both days are consecutive days to Sunday. `OneHotEncoding` converts this categorical data to numerical data that the ML model can use."

    "Once, the top features exlcuding the target feature of covid beds has been determined. Further feature engineering can be done. For example, just by inspection there are many variables above that are very similar/correlated but there is no reason to include all these features which represent the same thing. For example, the death tally over 28 days, 60 days or the death rate for those periods describe the same data but in different contexts. Having only one of them is enough to encapsulate the information whilst reducing the number of features at the same time. Inputting high dimensional data with highly correlated features would result in a ML model overfitting due to the computational complexity. We can check if any other features are highly correlated and remove them from the combined dataframe. This can be done to remove redudant features."

For this task, because of the complexity of the features and the non-linear relationships within the data it is probably best to use `RandomForest` or `XGBoost` to capture these complex relations between the features and the target variable. Additionally, `RandomForest` and `XGBoost` can deal with multi-dimensional data and has the ability to select the best features for the regression task."

    "All in all, the model predicted the number of COVID beds and deaths required fairly well given the data. Ideally, with more computing power, the training and testing window and the hyperparameters could have been found more accurately. To improve the code, all the data preprocessing and the training could have been combined into one ML pipeline that can be run on all the data. Furthermore, we could have compared the PCA reduction with a basic Random Forest feature importance selection to cross-check whether PCA was picking up the most important results or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given more time, some of the features could have been combined or multiplied together to see how the results are affected. In addition, more feature could have incorporated by examining the optimal boundary to set the cross-correlation threshold when deciding if a dataset is correlated or not. This could have been done by varying the cross-correlation threshold and observing how the ML model improves over time."
